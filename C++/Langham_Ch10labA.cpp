/*
Directions:
You will write a program that allows the user to enter 10 songs and 
their artists into a playlist and will sort the entries by artist order. 
The program should use a 10 element array of structure objects that holds
two string variables:  artist and title.  Once the data has been read in 
and stored, it should sort the entries in ascending order by artist. 
It should then display the sorted array with appropriate headings.

Modularity:  
The main function should create the Playlist object and call at least 3 other functions:

1. Get the data from the user. Using a loop, have the user populate the 
    playlist object array with 10 artist and songs in no particular order.
    No validation is necessary. However, you should use the C++ getline 
    function instead of cin so that the user can type spaces in the name 
    and song title.
2. Sort the list. You may use either the bubble sort or the selection 
    sort to sort your playlist.
3. Display the list. The function should display the artist and title
    in sorted order with appropriate headings.  

Sample Output:

Playlist

Artist-Title
============================================
1. Cream - Sunshine of Your Love
2. Jimi Hendrix - All Along the Watchtower
3. Stevie Ray Vaughn - Texas Flood
4. ZZ Top - La Grange
